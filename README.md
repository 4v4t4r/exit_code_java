# Pre-Release 8
Hello, world!

I am happy to announce that after much delay, Pre-Release 8 is rolling out.

I am exhausted... This update has been a nightmare. But in the end, I think it was worth it.

First and foremost: I re-wrote the window handling system. This made the file slightly smaller, but most importantly made this update's main feature possible.

I also implemented a new ProcessID system. And Terminal commands to go along with them. It's not perfect, but you can see what apps are open within the Terminal, and you can kill them using their PID number.

A while back I posted to Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/posts/... ) showing off a nice piece of artwork by David Refoua. This beautiful piece is now the official wallpaper that comes with the game. In the future, the game will come with multiple images and you will be able to select which one fits you best.

And now to the main event, and why this update is so overdue: App resizing! You can now resize all of the in-game apps. It seems like such a small thing. But it was a nightmare to implement. Though, I'm glad I did. This is the first feature a user came up and asked me for and I am happy that I was able to see it through.

Now, I am just one person. I have a vision, a dream; of what this game can be. But I can't do it alone. If you would please leave your suggestions for what should be added next, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for all the support.

This update will be exclusive to patreon for now. Probably until Pre-Release 9 - As a thank you for your support.

#### Pre-Release 9
I'm really excited about Pre-Release 9, and I think you guys will love it too!
Sorry, no spoilers. Also I would hate to announce a feature and not be able to deliver. This was almost the case the Pre-Release 8's App Resizing: where I didn't officially announce it, but I did tell a bunch of people about it because I thought I was almost done and it almost blew up in my face. So this time around the release notes are staying with me until the jar is up for download.

One thing I will say, which isn't really good news, is that there is a real os called NIXos. It's a Linux distro. So, we're having to change our in-game OS branding. For now we're going with PiXELos, but this might change. Whatever we go with, it will be decided, and shipped with Pre-Release 9, and I might patch Pre-Release 8 as well and replace the wallpaper.

Thanks for the support!
