# Pre-Release 7
Hello world!
Sorry for the delay.. I wasn't feeling well, so I took a few days to myself.
On top of that I can't have caffeine with my anti-stress meds so #TheStruggleIsReal XDD

Today I bring to you Pre-Release 7. This includes the first edition of the in-game Terminal. The game is now fullscreen by default (to fix some annoying bugs with apps) but this is how the game should be played anyways. I will probably remove the button toggle for fullscreen and instead put it in a debug command within the terminal - still playing with the idea.

This update will be exclusive to patreon for now. Maybe even until pre-re_8 - As a thank you for your support.
